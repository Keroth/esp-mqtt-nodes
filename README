ESP MQTT Nodes
==============

This repository contains various Arduino sketches for ESP8266 nodes.
All sketches read some sensor data and publishes the results to an MQTT server.

Most configurations contain sensible defaults for the Mainframe hackerspace.

Features
--------

- Support for multiple Wifi networks with WifiMulti
- Automatic reconnect
- `delay`-free for reliable Wifi/MQTT connections
- External `settings.h` and `credentials.h` for easy configuration


Nodes
-----

`dht-node`: Reads temperature and humidity from DHT sensors.

`power-node`: Reads ticks from an electric meter, calculates current
    power consumption and published this and the counted meter value.


Create new nodes
----------------

`template` is a commented template for a new node.
